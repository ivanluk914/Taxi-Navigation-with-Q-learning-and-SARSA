# Taxi-Navigation-with-Q-learning-and-SARSA
This repository contains the implementation of Q-learning and SARSA algorithms for a taxi navigation problem using the Gym library. The project involves training a model to minimize the number of steps the taxi takes to pick up and drop off a passenger while avoiding illegal actions.
